% Classical definition of DFA
\begin{ncdefine}{Deterministic Finite Automata}{def:DFAs}{\quad\\}
A \emph{deterministic finite automaton} (DFA) is a tuple $\tuple{Q,\actions,\delta,q_0,A}$, where:
\begin{compactitem}
\item
$Q$ is a finite set of \emph{states};
\item
$\actions$ is a finite set of actions, called the \emph{alphabet};
\item
$\func{\delta}{Q \times \actions}{Q}$ is the \emph{transition function};
\item
$q_0 \in Q$ is the \emph{start state}; and
\item
$A \subseteq Q$ is the set of \emph{accept states}.
