\begin{ncdefine}{Information model}{def:info:model}{\quad\\}
An \emph{information model} is a 5-tuple $(E,R,\rho,\eta,\Psi)$, where:
\begin{compactitem}
\item
$E \subseteq \powerset{\identifiers}$ is a finite set of \emph{entity types};
\item
$R \subseteq \labels$ is a finite set of \emph{relation types};
\item
$\func{\rho}{R}{\kleenestar{E}}$ is a \emph{relation definition function} that maps every relation type onto a finite sequence of entity types;
\item
$\func{\eta}{E}{R}$ is an \emph{entity relation definition function} that maps every entity type onto a relation type such that
$\eta$ is injective and for every $e \in E$ it holds that $\funcCall{\rho}{\funcCall{\eta}{e}}=\sequence{e}$, $\funcCall{\eta}{e}$ is called the \emph{entity relation} of $e$;
\item
$\Psi$ is a collection of statements in first-order logic that for every $r \in R$, $n=|\funcCall{\rho}{r}|$, 
(i) can use predicate $r$ over the domain $\identifiers^n$, called the \emph{relation predicate} of $r$, 
and (ii) contains the statement:
\[
\mathop{\bigforall} i \in \identifiers^n \holds \left(\funcCall{r}{i(1),\ldots,i(n)} \implies \left(\bigwedge_{k=1}^{n} \funcCall{\funcCall{\eta}{\funcCall{\rho}{r}(k)}}{i(k)}\right)\right),
\]
%\[ deprecated formulation
%\mathop{\bigforall}_{j=1}^{n} i_j \in \identifiers \holds \left(\funcCall{r}{i_1,\ldots,i_n} \implies \left(\bigwedge_{k=1}^{n} \funcCall{\funcCall{\eta}{\funcCall{\rho}{r}(k)}}{i_k}\right)\right),
%\]
called the \emph{relation predicate statement} of $r$.

\begin{define}{Population, Fact}{def:info:model:population}{\quad\\}
A \emph{population} of an information model $(E,R,\rho,\eta,\Psi)$ is a function $\func{\pi}{R}{\powerset{\bigcup_{n \in \natnum}{\identifiers^n}}}$
such that every element in the population is correctly typed, \ie
for every $r \in R$ it holds that $\funcCall{\pi}{r} \in \powerset{\prod_{i=1}^{|\funcCall{\rho}{r}|}{\!\funcCall{\rho}{r}(i)}}$.
An element in $\funcCall{\pi}{r}$ is called a \emph{fact}.
