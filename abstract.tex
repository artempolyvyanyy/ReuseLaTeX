Adapted from Springer: An effective title should convey the main topics of the study, highlight the importance of the research, be concise, and attract readers.
To compose a good title, list all the topics/contributions of the paper using as few words as possible and include all the most relevant ones in the title.
A long title will appear clumsy and annoy readers.
